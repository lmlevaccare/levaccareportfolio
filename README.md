#For the assigment I created the frame-work for my responsive portfolio.
# This included my home/about me page, contact page, and portfolio/work page.

#I added my bio, name, self-images, and links to my email, github and linkedin. 
#Also included semantic HTML.

#Further, I used HTML links and CSS to personalize page’s with added images, back-ground image and google fonts. 
#I implemented code from Bootstrap’s responsive grid system’s, Jumbotron and nav-bar. 
#My goal was to keep the page clean and “dry” as I plan to layer further content throughout the program.

#Still, the *contact form* on my contact page is inactive.
#I plan to add the JS needed to activate in the coming weeks.
