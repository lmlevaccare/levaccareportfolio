# levaccareportfolio

I created the frame-work for my responsive portfolio with semantic HTML.


Included, are links to my email, github and linkedin. I also created a nav bar to direct the user to my portfolio page where they can view my work.


#To personalize the pages,I imported images for the back-ground; I used google-fonts for the text and implemented code from Bootstrap’s responsive grid system’s. 
#My goal was to keep the page clean and “dry” as I plan to layer further content throughout the program.


#I plan to add more project file links through-out the bootcamp timeframe.
